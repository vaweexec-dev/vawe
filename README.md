![Wave Executor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/092e5a49-c7fc-462f-96c6-f15012c56e34)

This is a Roblox script executor—a tool that allows users to run Lua scripts within Roblox games. These scripts can modify gameplay, automate actions, or add entirely new functionalities. While premium executors often dominate the scene, it sets itself apart by offering a no-cost, ad-free experience with solid performance and regular updates.
